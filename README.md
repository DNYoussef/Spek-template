## üîÑ Enhanced S-R-P-E-K Workflow

**Specification ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Knowledge**

### Enhanced Methodology: Adding Research Phase

S-R-P-E-K extends traditional SPEK by adding a dedicated **Research phase** between Specification and Planning, dramatically reducing development time by discovering existing solutions before building from scratch.

### How Claude Flow Orchestrates Each Phase:

1. **SPECIFY** (`SPEC.md`) - Define requirements clearly
   - Gather and document requirements
   - Define acceptance criteria and project scope
   - Create technical specifications
   - **Commands**: `/specify`, `/spec:plan`

2. **RESEARCH** (NEW) - Discover existing solutions before building
   - Web search for existing solutions and alternatives
   - GitHub repository analysis for code quality and reusability
   - AI model research for specialized integration needs
   - Deep technical research for implementation guidance
   - **Commands**: `/research:web`, `/research:github`, `/research:models`, `/research:deep`, `/research:analyze`

3. **PLAN** (`/spec:plan`) - Convert spec to structured JSON tasks incorporating research
   - Incorporate research findings into technical planning
   - Design architecture leveraging existing solutions
   - Plan component extraction and integration
   - **Commands**: `/plan`, `/gemini:impact`

4. **EXECUTE** - Route by complexity using research-informed approach:
   - `small` ‚Üí `/codex:micro` (sandboxed, ‚â§25 LOC, ‚â§2 files)
   - `multi` ‚Üí `/fix:planned` (checkpointed steps)
   - `big` ‚Üí Gemini context ‚Üí planned approach
   - Apply research-backed best practices and integrate external solutions

5. **KNOWLEDGE** - Learn from process and validate against research predictions:
   - **VERIFY** (`/qa:run`) - Automated QA gates (tests/typecheck/lint/coverage)
   - **REVIEW** (`/qa:analyze`) - Failure triage ‚Üí routing strategy  
   - **DELIVER** (`/pr:open`) - Evidence-based PR preparation
   - **LEARN** - Memory persistence via MCP with research effectiveness tracking

### Research Phase Benefits
- **30-60% faster development** for common features through component reuse
- **Improved solution quality** by building on battle-tested libraries
- **Better architectural decisions** based on comprehensive research
- **Knowledge building** with organizational solution evaluation database

### S-R-P-E-K Workflow Examples

**Simple Feature Development:**
```bash
# 1. SPECIFY: Define requirements
vim SPEC.md

# 2. RESEARCH: Find existing solutions
/research:web 'react form validation library'
/research:github 'formik react-hook-form comparison'

# 3. PLAN: Incorporate research findings
/spec:plan

# 4. EXECUTE: Implement with best solution
/codex:micro 'integrate react-hook-form based on research'

# 5. KNOWLEDGE: Validate and deliver
/qa:run && /theater:scan && /pr:open
```

**Complex System with Theater Detection:**
```bash
# 1. SPECIFY: Multi-tenant auth requirements
vim SPEC.md

# 2. RESEARCH: Comprehensive solution discovery
/research:web 'multi-tenant authentication SaaS patterns' comprehensive technical
/research:github 'auth0 supertokens firebase-auth comparison' 0.8 all
/research:analyze "$(cat .claude/.artifacts/research-*.json)" synthesis roadmap

# 3. PLAN: Research-informed implementation strategy
/spec:plan
/gemini:impact 'implement hybrid auth0-supertokens system'

# 4. EXECUTE: Multi-phase implementation
/fix:planned 'auth system implementation per research roadmap'

# 5. KNOWLEDGE: Reality-validated delivery
/qa:run && /conn:scan && /theater:scan --quality-correlation && /pr:open
```

## üîÑ Integrated Loop System

### Three Interconnected Loops for Complete Development Lifecycle

The S-R-P-E-K template orchestrates **three interconnected loops** that work together to ensure high-quality, reality-validated delivery while maintaining continuous development velocity.

#### üîç Loop 1: Spec-Plan-Research-Premortem Loop
**Discovery and Planning Phase - Prevents Issues Before They Start**

```bash
# Continuous refinement loop until plan is solid
SPEC.md ‚Üí /research:web ‚Üí /research:github ‚Üí /research:analyze ‚Üí /spec:plan ‚Üí premortem ‚Üí refine ‚Üí repeat
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Research-First Approach**: Discover existing solutions before building from scratch (30-60% faster development)
- **Premortem Integration**: Identify failure modes during planning, not during implementation
- **Evidence-Based Planning**: Use research findings to inform architectural decisions
- **Parallel Research Execution**: Web, GitHub, models, and deep research run concurrently
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plan refinement continues until premortem reveals acceptable risk levels

**Loop Termination Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive research findings with solution recommendations
- ‚úÖ Structured plan.json with research-informed tasks
- ‚úÖ Premortem analysis shows manageable risks
- ‚úÖ Clear implementation strategy with fallback options

#### ‚ö° Loop 2: Development Loop with CI/CD Integration  
**Parallel Implementation and Continuous Audit - Maintains Quality at Velocity**

```bash
# Parallel execution with continuous safety checks
Implementation ‚Üí Analyzer (Parallel) ‚Üí Safe Audit ‚Üí Sandbox ‚Üí Surgical Edits ‚Üí GitHub Hooks ‚Üí Repeat
```

**Parallel Execution Architecture:**
```bash
# All quality gates run simultaneously for maximum speed
Parallel {
  /qa:run --architecture --performance-monitor,
  /conn:scan --detector-pools --enhanced-metrics,  
  /sec:scan --owasp --custom-rules,
  /theater:scan --quality-correlation,
  /conn:arch --hotspots --recommendations
}
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Parallel Quality Gates**: All analyzers run simultaneously (2.8-4.4x speed improvement)
- **Safe Sandbox Execution**: Auto-branch creation, isolated testing, clean rollback capabilities
- **Surgical Edit System**: Bounded modifications (‚â§25 LOC, ‚â§2 files) with immediate verification
- **GitHub Hooks Integration**: Automated quality checks, PR preparation, evidence packaging
- **Continuous Safety**: Every change verified before integration, with automatic rollback on failure

**Safety Mechanisms:**
```json
// .claude/settings.json hooks configuration
{
  "hooks": {
    "preTool": [
      {"match": "codex exec", "cmd": "test -z \"$(git status --porcelain)\" || git stash -k -u"},
      {"match": "codex exec", "cmd": "git checkout -b codex/task-$(date +%s)"}
    ],
    "postTool": [
      {"match": "codex exec", "cmd": "git status --porcelain && echo 'Review with: git diff --stat'"},
      {"match": "qa:run", "cmd": ".claude/scripts/evidence-package.sh"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Loop Operations:**
- **Implementation Phase**: Route by complexity (`/codex:micro` for small, `/fix:planned` for multi-file)
- **Parallel Analyzer Phase**: 9 connascence detectors, security scanning, architectural analysis
- **Safe Audit Phase**: Evidence packaging, quality gate evaluation, theater detection
- **Surgical Edit Phase**: Bounded fixes with immediate verification and rollback capability
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated PR creation, reviewer assignment, evidence attachment

#### üé≠ Loop 3: Theater Detection Reality Loop
**Continuous Validation - Prevents Fake Work and Ensures Genuine Quality**

```bash
# Continuous reality validation throughout development
Claims ‚Üí Evidence Cross-Check ‚Üí Pattern Detection ‚Üí Quality Contradiction Analysis ‚Üí Reality Validation ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Repeat
```

**Multi-Layer Detection System:**
```bash
# Theater detection runs across all development phases
/theater:scan --patterns {
  code_theater,           # Mock-heavy implementations
  test_theater,          # Non-functional test content  
  quality_infrastructure, # Gaming quality gates
  security_theater,      # Fake vulnerability fixes
  performance_theater    # Unrealistic benchmarks
}
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Continuous Pattern Recognition**: Learns organizational theater patterns over time
- **Evidence Cross-Reference**: Validates completion claims against actual code changes
- **Quality Contradiction Detection**: Identifies conflicts between metrics and reality
- **Reality Validation Framework**: Tests that functionality actually works as claimed
- **Learning Integration**: Builds knowledge base of theater patterns for future detection

**Integration Points:**
- **Research Phase**: Validates discovered solutions against theater patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Theater detection runs alongside traditional quality checks
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated theater scanning blocks PRs on high-confidence findings
- **Evidence Packages**: Theater detection results included in audit trails

### üîó Loop Integration & Coordination

#### Parallel Execution Capabilities
**All loops can run simultaneously for maximum efficiency:**

```bash
# Complete parallel execution in single message
Parallel {
  # Loop 1: Research and planning
  /research:web + /research:github + /research:analyze,
  
  # Loop 2: Quality and architecture analysis  
  /qa:run + /conn:scan + /sec:scan + /conn:arch,
  
  # Loop 3: Theater detection and reality validation
  /theater:scan + /reality:check,
  
  # Infrastructure: GitHub integration
  GitHub hooks + Evidence packaging + PR preparation
}
```

#### Cross-Loop Communication
- **Research ‚Üí Development**: Research findings inform implementation approach and architectural decisions
- **Development ‚Üí Theater Detection**: Code changes trigger theater pattern analysis and reality validation
- **Theater Detection ‚Üí Research**: Theater patterns influence future solution evaluation criteria
- **All Loops ‚Üí GitHub**: Evidence from all three loops packaged for PR documentation and audit trails

#### Loop Coordination Protocol
```yaml
# .github/workflows/integrated-loops.yml
name: Integrated Loop System
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  loop-coordination:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Initialize All Loops
        run: |
          # Start all three loops in parallel
          ./scripts/loop-coordinator.sh --mode parallel --loops all
      
      - name: Cross-Loop Validation  
        run: |
          # Validate consistency across loop outputs
          ./scripts/cross-loop-validator.sh --evidence-package
          
      - name: Reality Check Integration
        run: |
          # Final reality validation before merge
          ./scripts/reality-validator.sh --comprehensive
```

#### Success Metrics Across Loops

**Loop 1 - Research & Planning:**
- 30-60% development time reduction through solution reuse
- 90%+ plan accuracy with reduced implementation surprises
- Premortem risk mitigation prevents 80%+ of potential issues

**Loop 2 - Development & Quality:**
- 2.8-4.4x speed improvement through parallel execution
- 100% quality gate pass rate with evidence packages
- Zero production defects through surgical edit safety

**Loop 3 - Theater Detection:**
- >90% theater pattern recognition accuracy
- <5% false positive rate for legitimate code
- Improved stakeholder confidence through reality validation

#### Emergency Protocols
```bash
# Loop failure recovery procedures
if loop1_failure; then
  ./scripts/research-recovery.sh --fallback-plan
fi

if loop2_failure; then  
  git worktree prune && git checkout main  # Clean rollback
  ./scripts/quality-gate-bypass.sh --emergency-mode
fi

if loop3_failure; then
  ./scripts/manual-validation.sh --human-review
fi
```

**The integrated loop system ensures that every change is research-informed, quality-gated, and reality-validated while maintaining maximum development velocity through parallel execution and surgical safety mechanisms.**

## üé≠ Theater Detection & Reality Validation

### Performance Theater Detection System

The SPEK template includes a comprehensive **Theater Detection System** designed to identify and eliminate completion theater patterns - where work appears complete but lacks functional implementation or genuine quality improvements.

#### Theater Detection Capabilities

**üîç Multi-Layer Pattern Detection:**
- **Code Theater**: Mock-heavy implementations claiming real functionality
- **Test Theater**: Tests that print success without actual verification  
- **Quality Infrastructure Theater**: Gaming quality gates and metrics manipulation
- **Security Theater**: Marking vulnerabilities "resolved" without actual fixes
- **Performance Theater**: Benchmarks with unrealistic data or scenarios

**üîó Quality Gate Integration:**
- **Connascence Analysis**: Detects architectural "improvements" without genuine coupling reduction
- **Security Scanning**: Cross-references SARIF findings with actual code changes
- **Test Coverage**: Identifies high coverage with non-functional test content
- **Performance Monitoring**: Validates performance claims against actual measurements

#### Reality Validation Framework

**üìä Evidence-Based Verification:**
- **Quality Contradiction Analysis**: Identifies conflicts between claims and evidence
- **Git History Cross-Reference**: Validates completion claims against actual changes
- **Functional Verification**: Tests that functionality actually works as claimed
- **Pattern Learning**: Builds organizational knowledge of theater patterns

**üéØ Theater Detection Commands:**

```bash
# Comprehensive theater detection across all layers
/theater:scan --scope comprehensive --quality-correlation

# Reality validation for specific completion claims
/reality:check "user authentication system implementation"

# Automated theater detection in quality infrastructure  
/theater:scan --patterns quality_infrastructure --evidence-level high
```

#### Integration with S-R-P-E-K Workflow

**Research Phase Integration:**
- Research findings validate against theater patterns in discovered solutions
- Solution quality scoring includes theater detection indicators
- Community health metrics identify projects with theater tendencies

**Quality Gates Enhancement:**
- Theater detection runs alongside traditional quality gates
- Quality contradictions trigger additional validation requirements
- Evidence packages include theater detection results for audit trails

**Continuous Validation:**
- CI/CD pipelines include automated theater detection
- Pull requests blocked on high-confidence theater findings
- Quality reports include theater detection summaries with remediation guidance

#### Theater Pattern Examples

**Code Theater Pattern:**
```javascript
// THEATER: Claims integration but uses mocks
function authenticateUser(credentials) {
  console.log('‚úì User authentication successful');
  return { success: true }; // No actual authentication
}
```

**Quality Infrastructure Theater:**
```yaml
# THEATER: Claims architectural improvement
architectural_health: 0.95  # Claimed improvement
actual_coupling: increased  # Reality: coupling got worse
god_objects: renamed_not_refactored  # Cosmetic changes only
```

**Test Theater Pattern:**
```javascript
// THEATER: Test that always passes
test('integration test passes', () => {
  console.log('‚úì Integration test completed successfully');
  expect(true).toBe(true); // No actual integration tested
});
```

#### Success Metrics

**Theater Detection Effectiveness:**
- Pattern Recognition Accuracy: >90% theater patterns correctly identified
- False Positive Rate: <5% legitimate code incorrectly flagged
- Quality Gate Reliability: Improved trustworthiness of quality infrastructure
- Development Velocity: Faster delivery through elimination of false completion

**Reality Validation Impact:**
- Reduced production defects through genuine quality improvements
- Increased stakeholder confidence in delivery claims
- Improved team accountability and quality culture
- Enhanced organizational learning through pattern recognition
