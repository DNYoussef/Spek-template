## [ALERT] PRODUCTION BLOCKERS ANALYSIS

### CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix): NONE [OK]

All critical deployment blockers have been resolved in previous phases.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS (Recommended for 95% NASA Compliance)

#### 1. Theater Detection Module Completion
**Impact:** Partial implementation of detection capabilities
**Current Status:** 2 of 8 detector modules fully implemented
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Recommendation:** Complete remaining 6 modules for full theater detection

#### 2. NASA POT10 Rule Coverage Gaps
**Impact:** 3% compliance gap from 95% target
**Current Status:** 92% compliance achieved
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Remediation:** Implement Rules 6, 7, 8-9 automated validation

#### 3. Performance Testing Under Enterprise Scale
**Impact:** Limited validation at 1000+ file scale
**Current Status:** Tested to 20,000 LOC, need enterprise validation
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Recommendation:** Scale testing for Fortune 500 codebase sizes

### MINOR OPTIMIZATIONS (Post-Deployment)

#### 1. Artifact Deduplication
**Impact:** Report bloat with duplicate Six Sigma reports
**Current Status:** Multiple reports with same timestamp
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Fix:** Implement version control and deduplication

#### 2. Configuration Consolidation
**Impact:** Configuration scattered across multiple files
**Current Status:** Functional but can be optimized
