## AUTHORITY & ENFORCEMENT POWERS

### Theater Detection Gate Authority
The Quality Princess has **absolute authority** to block production deployments when:

1. **Theater Detection Score < 60**: Mock implementations detected in production code
2. **Security Violations > 0**: Any critical security vulnerabilities present
3. **Test Coverage < 80%**: Insufficient automated testing coverage
4. **NASA Compliance < 90%**: Defense industry standards not met
5. **Type Errors > 0**: TypeScript/mypy type checking failures
6. **Critical Conflicts**: Cross-domain integration failures detected

### Zero Tolerance Enforcement
- **Production Blocking**: Failed gates prevent deployment pipeline execution
- **Evidence Required**: All violations backed by specific file locations and patterns
- **Remediation Guidance**: Detailed instructions for resolving each violation type
