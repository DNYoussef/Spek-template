## Baseline Scan Results

### Overall Metrics
```
Files Analyzed:        885
Total Violations:      19,535  (up from 19,453)
Files with Violations: 757     (85.5% of codebase)
Connascence Index:     59,778  (up from 59,646)
Violations per File:   25.81   (up from 21.98)
```

### Violations by Severity
```
Critical (CoA):  1,256  (6.4%)  - Algorithm duplication
High (CoP):      3,119  (16.0%) - Long functions
Medium (CoM):    15,160 (77.6%) - Magic numbers/meaning
```

**Change from Initial Scan:**
- Critical: +1 violation (1,255 → 1,256)
- High: +15 violations (3,104 → 3,119)
- Medium: +66 violations (15,094 → 15,160)
- Total: +82 violations (19,453 → 19,535)

**Analysis**: Small increase expected after syntax fixes allow more files to be parsed. The newly accessible code revealed additional violations that were previously hidden behind syntax errors.

## Infrastructure Validation

### Deployed Components

**1. Post-Edit Scanning** ✅
- `scripts/analyze-file.py` - Python analyzer wrapper
- `scripts/post-edit-scan.sh` - Bash validation script
- Detects violations immediately after file edits
- Returns exit codes for CI/CD integration

**2. Quality Gate Enforcement** ✅
- `scripts/quality-gate-check.py` - Gate validation
- Enforces thresholds:
  - Gate 1: 0 critical violations
  - Gate 2: <100 high violations
  - Gate 3: <100 god objects
- Currently: 3/3 gates failing (expected at baseline)

**3. Git Pre-Commit Hook** ✅
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Automatic validation
- Scans modified files before commit
- Blocks commits with violations
- Override with `--no-verify` flag

**4. Progress Tracking** ✅
- `.claude/.artifacts/remediation-progress.json` - Metrics tracking
- Phase completion status
- Violation reduction tracking
- Timeline monitoring

### Infrastructure Test Results

**Post-Edit Scanner:**
- ✅ Detects NASA violations (nesting depth)
- ✅ Detects connascence violations (magic literals)
- ✅ Creates JSON outputs correctly
- ✅ Returns proper exit codes

**Quality Gate Checker:**
- ✅ Counts 467 god objects (>500 LOC)
- ✅ Identifies 1,256 critical violations
- ✅ Identifies 3,119 high violations
- ✅ Enforces all 3 gates correctly

**Git Pre-Commit Hook:**
- ✅ Executes on commit
- ✅ Scans only modified files
- ✅ Blocks commits with violations
- ✅ Allows bypass with --no-verify

## Current Quality Gate Status

### Gate 1: Critical Violations
```
Current: 1,256
Target:  0
Status:  ❌ FAIL (1,256 violations to fix)
```

### Gate 2: High Violations
```
Current: 3,119
Target:  <100
Status:  ❌ FAIL (3,019 violations to fix)
```

### Gate 3: God Objects
```
Current: 467
Target:  <100

```
Current: 19,535
Target:  <100
