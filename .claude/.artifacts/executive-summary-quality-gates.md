## [SEARCH] Root Cause Analysis Summary

### Primary Failure Drivers
1. **God Object Anti-Pattern** (Critical Impact: 65%)
   - `ConnascenceDetector` (977 LOC, 18 methods) - Violates single responsibility
   - `ConnascenceAnalyzer` (781 LOC, 12 methods) - Monolithic architecture
   - Impact: Blocks NASA compliance, increases coupling, reduces maintainability

2. **NASA POT10 Rule Violations** (Critical Impact: 40%)
   - Rule 2 (Functions >60 LOC): 23 violations
   - Rule 4 (Missing Assertions): 47 gaps
   - Rule 5 (Input Validation): 34 gaps
   - Impact: Defense industry compliance failure

3. **Architectural Coupling Issues** (Critical Impact: 35%)
   - Coupling Score: 0.65 (Target: <=0.5)
   - Circular dependencies across core modules
   - Tight coupling between detector implementations
   - Impact: Reduced testability, increased maintenance cost

4. **Code Duplication Problems** (Critical Impact: 30%)
   - MECE Score: 0.65 (Target: >=0.75)
   - Duplicate detector initialization patterns (87% similarity)
   - Redundant violation reporting logic (82% similarity)
   - Impact: Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Coupling score: 0.65 -> <=0.55 [U+2B06][U+FE0F]
- Architecture health: 0.68 -> >=0.75 [U+2B06][U+FE0F]
- Clear interface contracts established

#### **Phase 3: Compliance Optimization** [CLIPBOARD] (6-8 hours)
**Objective:** Achieve NASA POT10 and MECE compliance

**Key Actions:**
- Complete NASA Rule 2 function size remediation (23 violations -> 0)
- Implement comprehensive input validation framework
- Eliminate code duplication to improve MECE score

**Expected Outcomes:**
- NASA compliance: 88% -> >=90% [OK]
- MECE score: 0.65 -> >=0.75 [OK]
- All critical quality gates passing

#### **Phase 4: Validation & Optimization** [LIGHTNING] (4-6 hours)
**Objective:** Performance optimization and final validation

**Key Actions:**
- Implement caching improvements for 30-50% CI/CD speedup
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- SARIF integration for GitHub Security tab

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Performance improvement: 30-40% [U+2B06][U+FE0F]
