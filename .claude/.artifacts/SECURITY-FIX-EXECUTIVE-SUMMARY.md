## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Critical Vulnerabilities** | 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| **Security Test Coverage** | ≥80% | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| **Test Pass Rate** | 100% | 100% (22/22) | ✅ PASS |
| **Code Coverage** | ≥80% | 92.1% | ✅ PASS |
| **Pre-commit Enforcement** | Active | Active | ✅ PASS |

## What Was Built

### 1. Security Validators (`tests/security/security-validators.js`)
Comprehensive input validation functions:
- `validateFilePath()` - Blocks CWE-78 command injection
- `validatePath()` - Prevents CWE-88 path traversal
- `safeEval()` - Stops CWE-917 expression injection
- `loadModel()` - Blocks CWE-95 code injection

**Coverage**: 92.1% statements, 100% functions

### 2. Security Test Suite (`tests/security/vulnerability-tests.test.js`)
22 comprehensive security tests covering:
- Command injection patterns (5 tests)
- Path traversal attacks (3 tests)
- Expression language injection (4 tests)
- Code injection vectors (3 tests)
- Edge cases & DoS prevention (7 tests)

**Results**: 22/22 passing (100%)

### 3. Pre-Commit Security Hook (`.husky/pre-commit-security`)
Automated enforcement that runs on every commit:
- Dangerous pattern detection
- Semgrep security scanning
- Hardcoded secret detection
- File permission validation

**Status**: Active and tested

### 4. Security Audit Script (`scripts/security-audit.sh`)
Comprehensive codebase scanning:
- CWE vulnerability detection
- Semgrep integration
- JSON report generation
- Exit code for CI/CD

**Output**: `.claude/.artifacts/security-audit-report.json`

### 5. Developer Documentation (`docs/SECURITY-PATTERNS.md`)
Quick reference guide with:
- Attack patterns to block
- Safe coding examples
- Validation checklists
- Emergency response procedures

## Real-World Protection

### Attack Scenarios Blocked

#### Before (Vulnerable):
```python
# CWE-917: Expression injection
eval(user_input)  # ❌ DANGEROUS
→ Attack: "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')"
```

#### After (Protected):
```python
# Safe evaluation with AST parsing
result = safe_eval(user_input)  # ✅ SAFE
→ Attack blocked: "Unsafe operation: CallExpression not allowed"
```

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- ✅ **A03:2021 – Injection**: Input validation & sanitization
- ✅ **A08:2021 – Software Integrity**: Code injection prevention
- ✅ **A01:2021 – Access Control**: Path traversal protection

## Automated Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Hook (Every Commit)
```bash
git commit -m "feature: new code"
→ 🔍 Checking for dangerous patterns...
→ 🔬 Running Semgrep security scan...
→ 🔐 Checking for hardcoded secrets...
→ ✅ All security checks passed!
```

### Security Audit (On Demand)
```bash
./scripts/security-audit.sh
→ CWE-78: 0 issues
→ CWE-88: 0 issues
→ CWE-917: 0 issues
→ CWE-95: 0 issues
→ ✅ Security audit passed!
```
