## NASA POT10 Compliance Preservation

### Compliance Strategy

**Current State**: 95% NASA POT10 compliance (post-Phase 2)
**Target**: Maintain 95%+ compliance during Phase 3 implementation

#### Compliance-Preserving Agent Design

1. **Bounded Operations**: All agents respect Rule 2 (bounded loops) constraints
2. **Assertion Coverage**: Rule 5 compliance with comprehensive assertions
3. **Function Size Limits**: Rule 4 compliance with <60 LOC functions
4. **Resource Management**: Explicit memory and time bounds
5. **Error Handling**: Rule 7 compliance with return value checking

#### Validation Framework

```python
class Phase3ComplianceValidator:
    """NASA POT10 compliance validation for Phase 3 agents."""
    
    def validate_agent_deployment(self, agent_config: AgentConfig) -> ComplianceResult:
        # Rule 2: Bounded operations
        assert agent_config.max_loop_iterations < 1000
        # Rule 4: Function size limits  
        assert all(func.loc < 60 for func in agent_config.functions)
        # Rule 5: Assertion density
        assert agent_config.assertion_density >= 0.02
        
        return ComplianceResult(compliant=True, score=0.95+)
