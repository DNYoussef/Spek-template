# MECE Task Division: NASA Compliance Remediation

## Principle: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive

### Total Scope
- **205 NASA violations** across 216 files
- **245 god objects** to analyze
- **Target**: 70%+ NASA compliance + <100 god objects

---

## MECE Breakdown

### Dimension 1: By NASA Rule Type (Mutually Exclusive)

**Task A: Rule 3 Violations (Nesting Depth)**
- **Count**: 113 violations
- **Files**: 32 unique files
- **Agent**: `coder` specialized in code flattening
- **Deliverable**: Refactored files with nesting depth ≤4

**Task B: Rule 2 Violations (Long Functions)**
- **Count**: 92 violations
- **Files**: 28 unique files
- **Agent**: `coder` specialized in function extraction
- **Deliverable**: Split functions all ≤60 LOC

**Mutual Exclusivity Check**: ✅ A violation is either Rule 3 OR Rule 2, never both simultaneously

---

### Dimension 2: By Work Type (Mutually Exclusive)

**Task C: Code Refactoring (Tasks A + B)**
- **Scope**: Fix 205 NASA violations
- **Agent Team**: 2 parallel coders
- **Output**: Refactored Python files

**Task D: Architectural Analysis (God Objects)**
- **Scope**: Analyze 245 god objects, categorize by LOC
- **Agent**: `system-architect` for decomposition strategy
- **Output**: God object reduction roadmap

**Task E: Compliance Monitoring**
- **Scope**: Track progress, run analyzer, generate reports
- **Agent**: `tester` for validation
- **Output**: Real-time compliance dashboard

**Mutual Exclusivity Check**: ✅ Each task type is distinct - no overlap between refactoring, analysis, and monitoring

---

### Dimension 3: By File Priority (Collectively Exhaustive)

**Tier 1 Files (Maximum Impact - Fix First)**
- `analyzer/ml_modules/compliance_forecaster.py` (12 violations)
- `analyzer/architecture/refactoring_audit_report.py` (8 violations)
- `analyzer/core.py` (5 violations)
- **Total**: 25 violations across 3 files
- **Impact**: 12.2% compliance gain
- **Agent**: Coder Agent 1 (high priority)

**Tier 2 Files (Moderate Impact)**
- `analyzer/context_analyzer.py` (6 violations)
- `analyzer/validation/reality_validation_engine.py` (6 violations)
- `analyzer/components/AnalysisOrchestrator.py` (5 violations)
- **Total**: 17 violations across 3 files
- **Impact**: 8.3% compliance gain
- **Agent**: Coder Agent 2 (medium priority)

**Tier 3 Files (Incremental Gains)**
- All remaining files with <5 violations each
- **Total**: 163 violations across 50+ files
- **Impact**: 79.5% of violations, diminishing returns
- **Agent**: Automated batch processing (if time permits)

**Collective Exhaustiveness Check**: ✅ Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 = 205 total violations (100% coverage)

## Agent Assignment Matrix

| Agent ID | Type | Specialty | Task | Files | Deliverable |
|----------|------|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Agent 1** | `coder` | Nesting depth reduction | Fix Rule 3 violations in Tier 1 files | 3 files (Tier 1 Rule 3) | Flattened code ≤4 depth |
| **Agent 2** | `coder` | Function extraction | Fix Rule 2 violations in Tier 1 files | 3 files (Tier 1 Rule 2) | Split functions ≤60 LOC |
| **Agent 3** | `system-architect` | God object decomposition | Analyze 245 god objects | All files | LOC categorization + strategy |
| **Agent 4** | `tester` | Compliance validation | Monitor + report progress | N/A | Real-time dashboard + final report |

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Agent Deployment (Simultaneous)
```
Agent 1 (Coder - Rule 3) ─┐
                           ├─→ Parallel Execution
Agent 2 (Coder - Rule 2) ─┤
                           ├─→ Orchestrated by Agent 4
Agent 3 (Architect - God) ─┤
                           │
Agent 4 (Tester - Monitor)─┘
```

### Phase 2: Validation & Iteration
- Agent 4 runs analyzer after Tier 1 complete
- If <70% compliance, deploy Agents 1+2 to Tier 2
- Agent 3 completes god object analysis independently

### Phase 3: Aggregation
- Agent 4 combines all results
- Generates final compliance report
- Validates quality gates

## MECE Validation Checklist

### Mutually Exclusive (No Overlaps)
- ✅ Rule 3 vs Rule 2: Different violation types
- ✅ Refactoring vs Analysis vs Monitoring: Different work types
- ✅ Tier 1 vs Tier 2 vs Tier 3: Non-overlapping file sets
- ✅ Agent 1 vs Agent 2: Different files, different patterns

### Collectively Exhaustive (Complete Coverage)
- ✅ Rule 3 (113) + Rule 2 (92) = 205 total violations ✓
- ✅ Tier 1 (25) + Tier 2 (17) + Tier 3 (163) = 205 ✓
- ✅ NASA violations + God objects = Full scope ✓
- ✅ 4 agents cover: Code fixes + Analysis + Validation ✓

## Expected Outcomes

### Agent 1 (Nesting Fixer)
- **Input**: 3 Tier 1 files with Rule 3 violations
- **Output**: Refactored code with depth ≤4
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes

### Agent 2 (Function Splitter)
- **Input**: 3 Tier 1 files with Rule 2 violations
- **Output**: Split functions ≤60 LOC each
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes

### Agent 3 (God Object Analyzer)
- **Input**: 245 god objects from god-object-count.json
- **Output**: LOC distribution + decomposition strategy
- **Time**: 15-20 minutes

### Agent 4 (Compliance Monitor)
- **Input**: Real-time progress from Agents 1-3
- **Output**: Compliance dashboard + final report
- **Time**: Continuous monitoring

### Combined Impact
- **Tier 1 Fixes**: 25 violations resolved = 12.2% compliance gain
- **Expected Score**: 47.19% + 12.2% = **59.39%**
- **If needed, Tier 2**: +8.3% = **67.69%** (approaching 70%)

## Coordination Protocol

1. **Launch all 4 agents in single message** (parallel execution)
2. **Agent 4 monitors Agent 1-3 progress**
3. **Agent 1-3 complete work independently** (no dependencies)
4. **Agent 4 aggregates results** when all complete
5. **Re-run analyzer** to validate final score
6. **Iterate if needed** (deploy to Tier 2)
