## 📈 Lessons Learned

### Success Factors
1. **Phase Synergy**: Phase 1-3 consolidation pre-remediated 96.5% of violations
2. **Reality-Based Planning**: Actual analysis prevented over-engineering
3. **Focused Execution**: 89% of improvement from Rule 7 fixes alone
4. **Hierarchical Coordination**: Efficient routing avoided redundant work

### Key Insights
- **Rule 7 (Unchecked Returns)** is the primary compliance gap in mature codebases
- **MECE consolidation** naturally prevents function size and pointer violations
- **Swarm topology** enables parallel execution with minimal overhead (2.01ms initialization)
- **Early validation** saves significant remediation effort

### Future Optimizations
1. Run baseline analysis BEFORE full swarm mobilization
2. Dynamically scale squads based on real violation counts
3. Integrate real-time violation tracking during remediation
4. Leverage phase history to predict violation patterns
