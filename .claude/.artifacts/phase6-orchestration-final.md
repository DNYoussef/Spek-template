### Priority 3: Integration Team (4-6 hours)
| Agent | Mission | Dependencies | Timeline | Status |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|--------|
| reviewer | Code review, quality gates, final validation | All fixes complete | 1 hour | ðŸ”„ WAITING |
| task-orchestrator | Continuous coordination & final go/no-go | All agents | 6 hours | âš¡ ACTIVE |

## Deployment Orchestration Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Stabilization (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Simultaneous deployment of infrastructure team
1. Deploy production-validator
   - Mission: Complete test infrastructure repair
   - Priority: Fix remaining Python test issues
   - Validate: Achieve >95% test execution rate

2. Deploy system-architect
   - Mission: Resolve container orchestration failures
   - Priority: Fix Docker environment detection
   - Validate: Stable deployment infrastructure
```

### Phase 2: Validation Execution (After Phase 1)
```bash
# Parallel deployment of validation team
3. Deploy security-manager (parallel)
   - Mission: Security compliance validation
   - Validate: Maintain 100% security score
   - Timeline: 1 hour

4. Deploy performance-benchmarker (parallel)
   - Mission: Performance budget compliance
   - Validate: <0.3% budget violations
   - Timeline: 2 hours
```

### Phase 3: Final Integration (After Phase 2)
```bash
# Integration and sign-off
5. Deploy reviewer
   - Mission: Code review and quality gates
   - Validate: All quality thresholds met
   - Timeline: 1 hour

6. Execute final validation scenarios
   - End-to-end integration testing
   - Deployment readiness confirmation
   - Go/no-go recommendation generation
```

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### ðŸ”¥ High-Risk Items (Active Monitoring)
1. **Container Orchestration**: May require architecture changes
2. **Phase 3 Integration**: External dependency risk
3. **Performance Budget**: Could block deployment if unfixable
4. **Integration Test Failures**: 12 critical failures need systematic resolution

### ðŸŸ¨ Medium-Risk Items (Managed)
- Documentation gaps
- Configuration environment issues
- Cross-framework integration complexity

### ðŸŸ¢ Low-Risk Items (Under Control)
- Security posture (maintained)
- NASA compliance (stable)
- Core architecture (validated)

## Success Metrics & Quality Gates

### Deployment Readiness Criteria
