# Phase 3 Agent Discovery: Executive Summary

## Mission Accomplished

**Phase 3 Step 2: Agent Discovery for Artifact Generation** has been successfully completed with comprehensive analysis and strategic recommendations for deploying 54+ specialized agents across 5 critical artifact generation domains.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive Agent Inventory
- **131 agent definitions** discovered across the SPEK system
- **54+ active agents** categorized and mapped to specific capabilities
- **24 agents** selected for optimal Phase 3 deployment
- **5 shared agents** identified for cross-domain efficiency

### 2. Domain-Specific Agent Mapping

| Domain | Agents Assigned | Performance Impact | Key Artifacts |
