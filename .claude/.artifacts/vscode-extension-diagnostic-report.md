## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "claude command not found in terminal"
**This is NOT an issue with the extension!**
- The VS Code extension works via `Ctrl+Escape`, not terminal
- Terminal `claude` command is a separate CLI tool
- You don't need the CLI to use the VS Code extension

### Issue 2: Extension not responding to Ctrl+Escape
**Solution**:
1. Reload VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Check extension is enabled: Extensions panel → Search "Claude Code" → Ensure enabled
3. Check VS Code Output: View → Output → Select "Claude Code" from dropdown

### Issue 3: API Key prompt keeps appearing
**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're pasting the full API key
2. Check `.claude/settings.json` was created
3. Verify you have write permissions in workspace
