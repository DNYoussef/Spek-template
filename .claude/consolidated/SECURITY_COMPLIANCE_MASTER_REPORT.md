## CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS

### 1. VSCode Extension Wrapper Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Not suitable for production without fixes
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)

**Primary Vulnerability: Command Injection via Delayed Expansion**
- **Classification:** CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)
- **Location:** `connascence-wrapper.bat` lines 12, 22, 28
- **Attack Vector:** Delayed expansion allows command injection through filename arguments
- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with user privileges

**Code Vulnerability:**
```batch
Line 12: set "cmd_line=--path %~2"
Line 22: set "cmd_line=!cmd_line! %%~a"
Line 28: "C:\Users\...\connascence.exe" !cmd_line!
```

**Exploitation Example:**
```batch
connascence-wrapper.bat analyze "test.py" --profile "modern & calc"
# Results in: connascence.exe --path test.py --policy modern & calc
# 'calc' executes as separate command after ampersand
```

**Additional Critical Issues:**
- **Path Traversal Risk:** Unvalidated file paths in wrapper
- **Privilege Escalation:** Potential if VSCode runs with elevated privileges
- **Command Execution:** Silent execution without user notification

### 2. Security Infrastructure Assessment

**Strengths Identified:**
- Python CLI demonstrates good input validation
- Comprehensive security scanning framework operational
- SARIF generation with security findings consolidation
- Zero dependency vulnerabilities (369 packages audited)

**Remaining Vulnerabilities:**
- **4 Critical Issues:** Code injection vectors, unsafe deserialization, command injection, path traversal
- **3 High Priority:** Weak cryptographic functions, unvalidated redirects, SQL injection potential
