   - **Root Cause**: Dead code, redundant implementations
   - **Impact**: Performance, maintainability
   - **Frequency**: Low
   - **Sigma Impact**: Minimal

### 2.2 Root Cause Analysis Framework (5 Whys + Fishbone)

**Fishbone Diagram Categories:**
```
Methods          Materials         Machines          Measurement
    |               |                 |                 |
    |               |                 |                 |
Long Methods -------|                 |                 |
Unused Params ------|                 |                 |
    |               |                 |                 |
    |            Legacy Code      CI/CD Tools     Quality Gates
    |            Dependencies    Static Analysis   Coverage Reports
    |               |                 |                 |
Manpower        Environment        Management
```

**5 Whys Analysis Example - Long Methods:**
1. **Why are methods too long?** → Complex business logic in single functions
2. **Why is business logic not decomposed?** → Lack of systematic refactoring
3. **Why is refactoring not systematic?** → No automated detection thresholds
4. **Why are thresholds not automated?** → Quality gates focus on critical issues
5. **Why don't gates catch method length?** → NASA POT10 rules prioritize safety over style

**Corrective Actions:**
- Implement method length monitoring in CI/CD
- Add automated refactoring suggestions
- Enhance quality gate granularity
