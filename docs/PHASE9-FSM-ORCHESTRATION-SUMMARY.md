// Workflow management
await orchestrator.registerWorkflow(workflow);
const result = await orchestrator.executeWorkflow('workflow-id', data);

// Monitoring
const status = orchestrator.getSystemStatus();
const metrics = orchestrator.getPerformanceMetrics();
const isHealthy = orchestrator.isSystemHealthy();
```
