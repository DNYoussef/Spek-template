**Unique Value**: Best for technical teams needing architectural understanding and enterprise features

## Content Coverage Gaps (MECE Violations)

### Overlapping Content (Not Mutually Exclusive)
1. **SPEK Workflow**: All three versions explain this but at different depths
2. **Command Lists**: Similar commands presented differently across versions
3. **Quality Gates**: Both Codex and Claude Code cover this extensively
4. **Installation Steps**: Overlap between Codex and Gemini versions

### Missing Content (Not Collectively Exhaustive)
1. **Troubleshooting Section**: Only Gemini version includes comprehensive support
2. **Migration Guide**: None address upgrading from previous versions
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Mentioned but not detailed in any version
4. **Community & Contributing**: Limited coverage across all versions
5. **API Reference**: Advanced integration details missing
6. **Deployment Strategies**: Production deployment specifics incomplete

## Recommended MECE Structure

### Section 1: Project Foundation (Gemini Lead)
- Project overview with clear value proposition
- Target audience and use cases
- Success metrics and outcomes

### Section 2: Getting Started (Codex Lead)
- Prerequisites and installation
- Quick start guide
- First project walkthrough

### Section 3: Core Workflow (All Contributors)
- SPEK methodology explanation (Gemini UX + Codex clarity)
- Command reference (Codex tables + Gemini categorization)
- Practical examples (Progressive from Gemini, Technical from Claude)

### Section 4: Architecture & Integration (Claude Code Lead)
- System architecture and design principles
- Integration points and capabilities
- Advanced features and extensibility

### Section 5: Quality & Production (Claude Code Lead + Codex Standards)
- Quality gates and standards
- Defense industry compliance
- Production deployment readiness

### Section 6: Support & Community (Gemini Lead)
- Troubleshooting and help resources
- Community and contributing guidelines
- Migration and upgrade paths

## Consolidation Strategy

1. **Lead Assignment**: Each section led by the version with strongest coverage
2. **Content Integration**: Combine complementary information from other versions
3. **Gap Filling**: Address missing content identified in MECE analysis
4. **Consistency**: Standardize formatting, terminology, and structure
5. **Validation**: Ensure no content duplication or gaps remain

## Next Steps

1. Create consolidated README using MECE structure
2. Integrate unique strengths from each version
3. Fill identified gaps with new content
4. Validate MECE compliance of final version
5. Test usability with different user personas
