## Content Coverage Gaps (MECE Violations)

### Overlapping Content (Not Mutually Exclusive)
1. **SPEK Workflow**: All three versions explain this but at different depths
2. **Command Lists**: Similar commands presented differently across versions
3. **Quality Gates**: Both Codex and Claude Code cover this extensively
4. **Installation Steps**: Overlap between Codex and Gemini versions

### Missing Content (Not Collectively Exhaustive)
1. **Troubleshooting Section**: Only Gemini version includes comprehensive support
2. **Migration Guide**: None address upgrading from previous versions
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Mentioned but not detailed in any version
4. **Community & Contributing**: Limited coverage across all versions
5. **API Reference**: Advanced integration details missing
6. **Deployment Strategies**: Production deployment specifics incomplete

## Recommended MECE Structure

## Consolidation Strategy

1. **Lead Assignment**: Each section led by the version with strongest coverage
2. **Content Integration**: Combine complementary information from other versions
3. **Gap Filling**: Address missing content identified in MECE analysis
4. **Consistency**: Standardize formatting, terminology, and structure
5. **Validation**: Ensure no content duplication or gaps remain

## Next Steps

1. Create consolidated README using MECE structure
2. Integrate unique strengths from each version
3. Fill identified gaps with new content
4. Validate MECE compliance of final version
5. Test usability with different user personas
