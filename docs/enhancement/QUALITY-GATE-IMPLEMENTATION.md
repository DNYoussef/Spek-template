# Quality Gate Strategy Implementation Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive quality gate strategy provides incremental thresholds with theater prevention and authentic validation. The system progresses through 4 milestones from current baseline (NASA: 19.3%, Sigma: 1.0) to production readiness (NASA: 95%, Sigma: 4.0).

## Current Status

```
NASA POT10 Compliance:  19.3% → Target: 95%
Six Sigma Level:        1.0   → Target: 4.0
DPMO:                   357K  → Target: <6.2K
Test Coverage:          0%    → Target: 90%
Security Score:         0%    → Target: 100%
```

## Theater Detection Framework

### Correlation Analysis
Ensures authentic quality improvements through statistical validation:

```python
# Minimum correlation threshold: 0.8
metrics_tracked = [
    "code_changes_vs_coverage_improvement",
    "test_additions_vs_defect_reduction",
    "security_fixes_vs_vulnerability_count",
    "refactoring_vs_complexity_reduction"
]
```

### Evidence Requirements
**Before Snapshot:**
- Test results
- Coverage report
- Security scan
- Performance baseline

**After Snapshot:**
- Test results
- Coverage report
- Security scan
- Performance comparison

### False Improvement Detection
**Patterns Detected:**
- Coverage without assertions
- Tests without edge cases
- Complexity hidden, not reduced
- Security scan disabled
- Performance tests mocked

**Detection Methods:**
- Assertion ratio check (≥0.7)
- Edge case validation (≥0.6)
- Complexity verification (cyclomatic)
- Security validation (active scan)
- Performance authenticity (real data)

## Usage

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install eva MCP for systematic evaluation
# (Already configured in MCP registry)

# Create baseline measurements
python scripts/quality-monitor.py
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Before commit: Run quality gate
./scripts/pre-commit-quality-gate.sh

# On milestone completion: Validate
python scripts/milestone-validation.py M1_FOUNDATION docs/metrics-current.json
```

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Setup cron job for hourly monitoring
0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python scripts/quality-monitor.py
```

### 4. Dashboard Access
```bash
# View current quality dashboard
cat docs/quality-dashboard.json | jq .
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Theater detection confirmed

### Rollback Steps
1. Git checkout last known good
2. Restore test baseline
3. Revert configuration changes
4. Notify team
5. Create incident report
6. Verify baselines restored

### Manual Review Required
- Architectural changes
- Breaking API changes
- Major refactoring
- Dependency updates

## Quality Dashboard

### Alert System
**High Severity:**
- Threshold violations → Block commit
- Regressions detected → Trigger review
- Theater detected → Rollback + review

**Medium Severity:**

**Low Severity:**
- Stagnation → Daily summary

## Evidence Archive
