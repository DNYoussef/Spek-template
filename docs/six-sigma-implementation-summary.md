## 2. Defect Root Cause Analysis

### Current Defect Categories (From 577 File Scan)

**Unused Parameters** (Minor Impact)
- **Root Cause**: Legacy code evolution, refactoring artifacts
- **Frequency**: Low
- **Impact**: Code cleanliness, maintainability
- **Action**: Automated detection and cleanup

**Long Methods** (Moderate Impact)
- **Root Cause**: Complex business logic, insufficient decomposition
- **Frequency**: Moderate
- **Impact**: Readability, testability, NASA POT10 compliance
- **Action**: Automated refactoring suggestions

**Code Waste** (Minor Impact)
- **Root Cause**: Dead code, redundant implementations

### 5 Whys Analysis Example
1. **Why are methods too long?** â†’ Complex business logic in single functions
2. **Why is business logic not decomposed?** â†’ Lack of systematic refactoring
3. **Why is refactoring not systematic?** â†’ No automated detection thresholds
4. **Why are thresholds not automated?** â†’ Quality gates focus on critical issues
5. **Why don't gates catch method length?** â†’ Need enhanced quality gate granularity

**Root Cause**: Enhanced quality gate granularity required for comprehensive coverage.
