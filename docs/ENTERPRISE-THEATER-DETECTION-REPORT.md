3. Security Controls (relative import issues)
4. Compliance Frameworks (module loading issues)
5. Zero Tolerance Standard (dependency on other validations)

## Technical Architecture

### Theater Detection Patterns

The system detects the following theater patterns:

```python
# Performance Theater Examples Detected
"# TODO.*performance"
"return\s+0\.0\s*#.*performance"
"fake.*metrics"
"dummy.*measurement"

# Compliance Theater Examples Detected
"# MOCK.*compliance"
"return\s+True\s*#.*compliant"
"fake.*evidence"
"dummy.*control"

# Security Theater Examples Detected
"# TODO.*crypto"
"return\s+\"encrypted\"\s*#.*fake"
"fake.*validation"
"mock.*authentication"

# Functionality Theater Examples Detected
"raise\s+NotImplementedError"
"return\s+None\s*#.*TODO"
"pass\s*#.*implement"
"# STUB.*implementation"
```

### AST Analysis Capabilities

- **Empty Function Detection**: Functions with comprehensive docstrings but no implementation
- **Hardcoded Return Analysis**: Detection of suspicious constant returns (0.0, 1.0, True, "success")
- **Pattern Matching**: Regular expression analysis with context extraction
- **Forensic Context**: Complete surrounding code context for evidence

### Mathematical Validation Framework

**Six Sigma Calculations Verified:**
- DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities): `(defects / opportunities) * 1,000,000`
- RTY (Rolled Throughput Yield): `(units_passed / units_processed) * 100`
- Sigma Level approximation based on DPMO thresholds
- Process capability calculations (Cp, Cpk)

**Validation Results:**
- Test cases with known correct answers: 5 defects/1M opportunities = 5.0 DPMO ✓
- RTY calculation: 95 passed/100 total = 95.0% RTY ✓
- Error margins: All calculations within <0.01 tolerance ✓
