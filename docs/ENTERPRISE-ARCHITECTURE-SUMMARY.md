### 🎛️ Feature Flag System

**Zero-Overhead Design**:
- Early return patterns for disabled features
- Cached feature status for performance
- Granular enablement control
- Instant rollback capability

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
enterprise:
  features:
    sixsigma:
      state: disabled  # Default: zero impact
      performance_impact: low
      min_nasa_compliance: 0.92
```
