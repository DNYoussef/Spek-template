## 🔄 Fallback Strategy Implementation

### Primary Fallback Paths
1. **Claude Opus 4.1** → **Claude Sonnet 4** (maintains reasoning capability)
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** → **Claude Sonnet 4** (loses large context but maintains functionality)
3. **Codex CLI** → **Claude Sonnet 4** (loses sandboxing but maintains coding capability)
4. **GPT-5** → **Claude Sonnet 4** (maintains development capability)
5. **Claude Sonnet 4** → **GPT-5** (optimizes for coding tasks)

### Emergency Fallback
- **All models** → **Claude Sonnet 4** (universal compatibility guarantee)

## 🎚️ Model Routing Conditions

### Automatic Gemini 2.5 Pro Routing
Agents will automatically use Gemini when:
- `large_context_required` - Analysis spans >50 files
- `research_synthesis` - Multi-source research needed
- `architectural_analysis` - System-wide impact assessment

### Automatic Codex CLI Routing
Agents will automatically use Codex when:
- `testing_required` - Quality assurance needed
- `sandbox_verification` - Safe execution required
- `micro_operations` - Bounded changes (≤25 LOC)
