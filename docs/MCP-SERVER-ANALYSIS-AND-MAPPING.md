## Configuration Template for All Agents

### Universal MCP Integration (All 85 Agents)
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  # Universal servers (required for all agents)
  - claude-flow    # Swarm coordination and orchestration
  - memory         # Cross-session state and learning
  - sequential-thinking  # Enhanced reasoning and analysis

  # Specialized servers (max 4 additional per agent)
  - [server_1]     # Primary functional server
  - [server_2]     # Secondary support server
  - [server_3]     # Tertiary specialized server
  - [server_4]     # Optional enhancement server

hooks:
  pre: |
    # Universal initialization for all agents
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "$TASK"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-$(date +%s)"
    memory_store "agent_start_$(date +%s)" "Task: $TASK"

  post: |
    # Universal cleanup for all agents
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "$(date +%s)"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
    memory_store "agent_complete_$(date +%s)" "Task completed"
```

## Performance and Resource Considerations

### MCP Server Resource Usage
- **High Resource**: claude-flow, github, playwright, firecrawl
- **Medium Resource**: eva, context7, deepwiki, plane
- **Low Resource**: memory, sequential-thinking, ref, markitdown

### Optimization Recommendations
1. **Batch Operations**: Group MCP calls when possible
2. **Caching**: Leverage memory MCP for frequently accessed data
3. **Lazy Loading**: Initialize specialized servers only when needed
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections across agent invocations
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement fallback mechanisms for remote servers

## Integration Verification

Each agent integration should verify:
1. ✅ Universal servers (claude-flow, memory, sequential-thinking) present
2. ✅ Maximum 4 specialized servers per agent
3. ✅ Appropriate server selection for agent function
4. ✅ Proper hooks configuration
5. ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms

This comprehensive mapping ensures optimal MCP server utilization across all 85 agents while maintaining performance and functionality standards.
