## Emergency Procedures

### Quality Gate Bypass
<!-- Only for emergency situations -->

If quality gates fail and emergency deployment is required:

1. **Justification Required**: Provide detailed business justification
2. **Approval Process**: Obtain management approval
3. **Risk Assessment**: Document potential impacts
4. **Monitoring Plan**: Define post-deployment monitoring
5. **Remediation Timeline**: Commit to quality restoration

**Bypass Authorization**:
- [ ] Business justification provided
- [ ] Management approval obtained
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Monitoring plan defined
- [ ] Remediation timeline committed
